# Key Principles of DevSecOps

## 1. Shift-Left Security
Move security practices earlier in the development lifecycle.

## 2. Automation
Automate security testing, code analysis, and compliance checks.

## 3. Continuous Monitoring
Monitor applications and infrastructure for threats in real time.

## 4. Collaboration
Encourage open communication between developers, security, and operations.

## 5. Security as Code
Treat security policies and configurations as code, version-controlled and reviewable.
