# What is DevSecOps?

**DevSecOps** stands for Development, Security, and Operations. It’s a cultural and technical movement that aims to embed security practices into the DevOps process, making security a shared responsibility for everyone involved in software delivery.

## Why DevSecOps?

- **Early Detection:** Identify vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- **Automation:** Integrate security checks into CI/CD pipelines.
- **Collaboration:** Break down silos between development, security, and operations teams.

> “Security is everyone’s job, not just the security team’s.”
