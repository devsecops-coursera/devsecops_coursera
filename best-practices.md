# DevSecOps Best Practices

- **Automate Security Testing:** Integrate static and dynamic analysis tools into your CI/CD pipeline.
- **Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manage infrastructure with code for repeatability and security.
- **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep libraries and containers up to date to avoid known vulnerabilities.
- **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant only the permissions necessary for each component.
- **Continuous Education:** Train your team on secure coding and DevSecOps practices.
- **Incident Response Planning:** Prepare for security incidents with clear processes and responsibilities.
